# RepoPilot AI

RepoPilot AI is a FastAPI-based codebase intelligence system that indexes public GitHub repositories and answers developer questions using keyword search, semantic search, RAG-based answer generation, repository summary generation, architecture explanation, bug-triage suggestions, background indexing jobs, persistent SQLite job storage, retry handling, failed-job logs, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The project helps developers understand unfamiliar repositories, locate relevant files, inspect architecture, and debug code faster using repository parsing, code chunking, embeddings, vector search, Groq-powered grounded answers, repository-level summaries, source-backed architecture explanations, source-backed bug triage, background job tracking, persistent job history, retry-aware failure handling, status filtering, source file references, and tested core workflows.

## How It Works

RepoPilot AI follows this workflow:

```text
GitHub repository URL
        ↓
Clone repository using GitPython
        ↓
Parse supported source-code and documentation files
        ↓
Ignore large/generated folders
        ↓
Store files for keyword search
        ↓
Split files into overlapping chunks
        ↓
Generate embeddings for chunks
        ↓
Store embeddings in ChromaDB
        ↓
Retrieve relevant chunks using semantic search
        ↓
Generate grounded answers, repository summaries, architecture explanations, or bug-triage suggestions using Groq LLM
        ↓
Return answer/summary/architecture/triage output with source file references
```

For background indexing, the workflow becomes:

```text
POST /index-job
        ↓
Create job_id
        ↓
Persist job metadata in SQLite
        ↓
Return response immediately
        ↓
Run indexing in background
        ↓
Retry failed indexing up to 2 attempts
        ↓
Store per-attempt logs in SQLite
        ↓
Update job status and attempt count
        ↓
GET /jobs/{job_id}
        ↓
Check pending/running/completed/failed status
        ↓
GET /jobs/{job_id}/logs
        ↓
Inspect job logs and failure reasons
```

The Streamlit dashboard uses this background indexing workflow and polls the backend until the indexing job is completed.

## File Parsing

RepoPilot AI supports common source-code and documentation file types, including:

* `.py`
* `.js`
* `.ts`
* `.tsx`
* `.jsx`
* `.java`
* `.cpp`
* `.c`
* `.h`
* `.hpp`
* `.cs`
* `.go`
* `.rs`
* `.php`
* `.rb`
* `.md`
* `.txt`
* `.json`
* `.yml`
* `.yaml`

It ignores folders that are usually large, generated, or unnecessary for code understanding:

* `.git`
* `node_modules`
* `venv`
* `.venv`
* `__pycache__`
* `dist`
* `build`
* `.next`
* `.idea`
* `.vscode`

## Keyword Search

The `/search` endpoint performs keyword-based search.

For each indexed file:

1. The file content is tokenized.
2. The query is tokenized.
3. Query-term matches are counted in each file.
4. Files are ranked by match score.
5. The API returns the top-K relevant files with snippets.

This is useful when the user knows the exact terms they want to search for, such as `multithreading`, `synchronization`, `database`, or `authentication`.

## Semantic Search

The `/semantic-search` endpoint performs semantic search using embeddings and ChromaDB.

For each indexed repository:

1. Parsed files are split into overlapping chunks.
2. Each chunk is converted into an embedding using SentenceTransformers.
3. Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB.
4. User queries are converted into embeddings.
5. ChromaDB retrieves semantically similar chunks.
6. The API returns relevant file paths, chunk indexes, distance scores, snippets, and query latency.

This allows RepoPilot AI to find relevant code even when the query does not exactly match the wording used inside the repository.

Example semantic query:

```text
Where is synchronization handled in this project?
```

## RAG Answer Generation

The `/ask` endpoint performs RAG-based question answering over the indexed repository.

For each question:

1. The question is converted into an embedding.
2. ChromaDB retrieves the most relevant code/documentation chunks.
3. Retrieved chunks are passed to the Groq LLM as grounded context.
4. The LLM generates an answer using only the retrieved repository context.
5. The API returns the answer along with relevant file references.

This makes RepoPilot AI useful for architecture understanding, debugging, and feature-navigation questions.

Example RAG question:

```text
Where is synchronization handled in this project?
```

## Repository Summary Generation

The `/repo-summary` endpoint generates a structured overview of the indexed repository.

For each summary request:

1. RepoPilot AI sends a broad repository-understanding query to the semantic vector store.
2. ChromaDB retrieves the most relevant repository chunks.
3. Retrieved chunks are passed to the Groq LLM as grounded context.
4. The LLM generates a structured summary using only the retrieved repository context.
5. The API returns the summary along with source file references.

The generated summary includes:

* Repository purpose
* Main technologies
* Core features
* Important files or modules
* Architecture or data flow
* What a new developer should read first

Example summary request:

```json
{
  "top_k": 10
}
```

Example summary sections:

```text
1. Repository Purpose
2. Main Technologies
3. Core Features
4. Important Files or Modules
5. Architecture / Data Flow
6. What a New Developer Should Read First
```

## Architecture Explanation

The `/architecture` endpoint generates a deeper technical architecture explanation for the indexed repository.

For each architecture request:

1. RepoPilot AI sends an architecture-focused query to the semantic vector store.
2. ChromaDB retrieves repository chunks related to modules, entry points, components, dependencies, setup, and execution flow.
3. Retrieved chunks are passed to the Groq LLM as grounded context.
4. The LLM generates a source-backed architecture explanation using only the retrieved repository context.
5. The API returns the architecture explanation along with source file references.

The generated architecture explanation includes:

* Architecture overview
* Entry points
* Main modules and responsibilities
* Data flow or execution flow
* Important files
* External services or dependencies
* How a new developer should navigate the codebase

Example architecture request:

```json
{
  "top_k": 10
}
```

Example architecture sections:

```text
1. Architecture Overview
2. Entry Points
3. Main Modules and Responsibilities
4. Data Flow / Execution Flow
5. Important Files
6. External Services or Dependencies
7. How a New Developer Should Navigate the Codebase
```

## Bug Triage

The `/bug-triage` endpoint generates source-backed debugging suggestions from a natural-language bug report.

For each bug-triage request:

1. RepoPilot AI combines the bug description with debugging-focused retrieval terms.
2. ChromaDB retrieves repository chunks related to the possible bug area.
3. Retrieved chunks are passed to the Groq LLM as grounded context.
4. The LLM generates a structured bug-triage report using only the retrieved repository context.
5. The API returns possible causes, relevant files, debugging steps, suggested fix direction, and source file references.

The generated bug triage includes:

* Bug summary
* Most relevant files
* Possible causes
* Debugging steps
* Suggested fix direction
* What is not clearly visible from retrieved context

Example bug-triage request:

```json
{
  "bug_description": "Search results are empty even after indexing the repository.",
  "top_k": 8
}
```

Example bug-triage sections:

```text
1. Bug Summary
2. Most Relevant Files
3. Possible Causes
4. Debugging Steps
5. Suggested Fix Direction
6. What Is Not Clearly Visible From Retrieved Context
```

## Background Indexing Jobs

RepoPilot AI supports background indexing jobs for a more scalable and production-like workflow.

Instead of waiting for repository indexing to complete in the same request, `/index-job` returns a `job_id` immediately. The indexing process then runs in the background, and the client can poll `/jobs/{job_id}` to check progress.

This demonstrates:

* Asynchronous backend workflow
* Job tracking
* Status polling
* Error reporting
* Retry handling
* Failed-job logs
* Persistent backend state management
* Separation between request submission and long-running processing
* Reliability-focused job metadata tracking

Job statuses:

```text
pending   → job has been created
running   → repository indexing is in progress
completed → repository indexing completed successfully
failed    → repository indexing failed after retries
```

## SQLite Persistent Job Storage

RepoPilot AI stores indexing jobs and job logs in a local SQLite database at:

```text
data/repopilot_jobs.db
```

This improves reliability because job history is preserved even if the backend server is stopped and restarted.

Each job stores:

* `job_id`
* `repo_url`
* `status`
* `files_indexed`
* `chunks_indexed`
* `indexing_time_ms`
* `error`
* `created_at`
* `started_at`
* `completed_at`
* `attempts`

The `/jobs` endpoint supports status filtering:

```text
GET /jobs
GET /jobs?status=completed
GET /jobs?status=failed
GET /jobs?status=running
GET /jobs?limit=50
```

This makes the job system closer to a production-style long-running task workflow.

## Retry Handling and Failed-Job Logs

RepoPilot AI retries failed background indexing jobs up to 2 attempts.

For every indexing job, RepoPilot AI stores structured logs in SQLite. These logs can be retrieved using:

```text
GET /jobs/{job_id}/logs
```

A successful job usually stores logs like:

```text
Indexing attempt 1 started.
Indexing completed successfully.
```

A failed job stores logs like:

```text
Indexing attempt 1 started.
Indexing attempt 1 failed.
Retrying indexing job after 2 seconds.
Indexing attempt 2 started.
Indexing attempt 2 failed.
Indexing job failed after maximum retry attempts.
```

Each log stores:

* `log_id`
* `job_id`
* `attempt`
* `level`
* `message`
* `error`
* `created_at`

This helps debug failed repository indexing attempts, such as invalid repository URLs, clone failures, network errors, or inaccessible repositories.

## Streamlit Dashboard

RepoPilot AI includes a Streamlit dashboard for using the system through a simple interface instead of only Swagger API calls.

The dashboard supports:

* Repository URL input
* Background indexing job creation using `/index-job`
* Live job-status polling using `/jobs/{job_id}`
* Job ID display
* Files indexed, chunks indexed, and indexing-time metrics
* Repository status refresh
* Persistent background job history using `/jobs`
* Keyword search with ranked results
* Semantic search with chunk-level results
* RAG-based question answering
* Answer latency display
* Source file references table

## Unit Testing

RepoPilot AI includes unit tests for core workflows using Pytest.

The tests cover:

* Text chunking behavior
* File-level chunk generation
* Repository parsing
* Supported file detection
* Ignored-folder filtering
* Keyword search ranking
* Top-K retrieval behavior
* SQLite job creation
* SQLite job updates

* SQLite job status filtering
* Job log creation
* Job log retrieval
* Repository summary request defaults
* Architecture request defaults
* Bug-triage request defaults

### `POST /ask`

Answers a natural-language question about the indexed repository using semantic retrieval and Groq LLM.

Request body:

```json
{
  "question": "Where is synchronization handled in this project?",
  "top_k": 5
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "answer_type": "rag",
  "question": "Where is synchronization handled in this project?",
  "top_k": 5,
  "answer_latency_ms": 815,
  "answer": "Based on the retrieved context, synchronization is handled using Windows Critical Sections. The project uses Windows Critical Sections to prevent multiple threads from writing to the shared data structure at the same time, avoiding race conditions and maintaining correctness during parallel indexing.",
  "sources": [
    {
      "path": "data\\doc3.txt",
      "chunk_index": 0,
      "distance": 1.031865119934082

      "chunk_index": 1,
      "distance": 1.4639391899108887
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /status`

Returns the current repository indexing status.

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "repo_url": "https://github.com/Palak123-coder/MiniSearchX",
  "files_indexed": 7,
  "chunks_indexed": 31,
  "indexing_time_ms": 6870,
  "error": null
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Palak123-coder/RepoPilot-AI.git
cd RepoPilot-AI
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```powershell
py -3.10 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

### 6. Run the FastAPI backend

```powershell
uvicorn backend.main:app
```

For development with auto-reload:

```powershell
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### 7. Open Swagger UI

Open this URL in your browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

### 8. Run the Streamlit dashboard

Open a new terminal, activate the virtual environment again, and run:

```powershell
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

Then open the Streamlit local URL shown in the terminal, usually:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

### 9. Run tests

```powershell
python -m pytest -v
```

## Example Usage

### Step 1: Start a background indexing job

Use `POST /index-job` with:

```json
{
  "repo_url": "https://github.com/Palak123-coder/MiniSearchX"
}
```

The API returns a `job_id`.

### Step 2: Check job status

Use `GET /jobs/{job_id}`.

Example completed response:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "files_indexed": 7,
  "chunks_indexed": 31,
  "indexing_time_ms": 6870,
  "error": null,
  "attempts": 1
}
```

### Step 3: Check job logs

Use `GET /jobs/{job_id}/logs`.

Successful jobs show start and completion logs. Failed jobs show start, failure, retry, and final failure logs.

### Step 4: Generate a repository summary

Use `POST /repo-summary` with:

```json
{
  "top_k": 10
}
```

The API returns a structured repository summary with source file references.

### Step 5: Generate an architecture explanation

Use `POST /architecture` with:

```json
{
  "top_k": 10
}
```

The API returns a source-backed architecture explanation with entry points, modules, execution flow, dependencies, and source file references.

### Step 6: Generate bug-triage suggestions

Use `POST /bug-triage` with:

```json
{
  "bug_description": "Search results are empty even after indexing the repository.",
  "top_k": 8
}
```

The API returns possible causes, relevant files, debugging steps, suggested fix direction, and source file references.

### Step 7: Confirm persistent job history

Stop the backend and restart it:

```powershell
CTRL + C
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

Then run:

```text
GET /jobs
```

The previous job should still appear because job history is stored in SQLite.

### Step 8: Filter jobs by status

```text
GET /jobs?status=completed
GET /jobs?status=failed
```

### Step 9: View job status in Streamlit

Open the Streamlit dashboard and click:

```text
Start Indexing Job
```

The dashboard will show:

```text
Job ID
Live Job Status
Files Indexed
Chunks Indexed
Indexing Time
```

### Step 10: Load job history

Click:

```text
Load Job History
```

This fetches job history from:

```text
GET /jobs
```

### Step 11: Run keyword search

Use `POST /search` or the Streamlit dashboard with:

```json
{
  "query": "multithreading synchronization",
  "top_k": 5
}
```

### Step 12: Run semantic search

Use `POST /semantic-search` or the Streamlit dashboard with:

```json
{
  "query": "Where is synchronization handled in this project?",
  "top_k": 5
}
```

### Step 13: Ask a RAG question

Use `POST /ask` or the Streamlit dashboard with:

```json
{
  "question": "Where is synchronization handled in this project?",
  "top_k": 5
}
```
